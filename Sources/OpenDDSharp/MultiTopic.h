		/// several topics. MultiTopic allows a more sophisticated subscription that can select and combine data received from multiple topics into a
		/// single resulting type(specified by the inherited type name). The data will then be filtered(selection) and possibly re-arranged
		/// (aggregation/projection) according to a subscription expression with the expression parameters.
		/// </summary>
		/// <remarks>
		/// <para>The subscription expression is a string that identifies the selection and re-arrangement of data from the associated
		/// topics. It is similar to an SQL clause where the SELECT part provides the fields to be kept, the FROM part provides the
		///	names of the topics that are searched for those fields, and the WHERE clause gives the content filter.The topics
		///	combined may have different types but they are restricted in that the type of the fields used for the NATURAL JOIN
		///	operation must be the same.</para>
		/// <para>The expression parameters are a collection of strings that give values to the ‘parameters’ ("%n" tokens) in
		/// the subscription expression. The number of supplied parameters must fit with the requested values in the
		///	subscription expression (the number of %n tokens).</para>
